My name is Tim Shi. I am the founder and principal of Tim Shi Software Development. I help companies build software products. 

My main area of expertise is building software as a service using the Spring Framework. Under the Spring umbrella, there is a collection of libraries that facilitates building large scale, high performance software services. In particular, the Spring Cloud, Spring Security and Spring Data libraries are the essential components to building such a service. While Spring Cloud offers the micro service pattern to help developer build resilient, reliable, and coordinated applications, Spring Security and Spring Data often needs to be extended or customized heavily from application to application. How should the application handle authentication request from clients? What mechanism should the API authorize requests? How does your application work with third party APIs? How to isolate access at the data layer for a multi tenanted application? How does your application handle SSO, either as a client or as a identity provider? These are the areas I can help.

My secondary area of expertise is signal processing for both image and audio. This mostly stems from my past experience working on iOS devices and current interest on the openCV library. Project range from fast fourier transform on iOS devices to image matching using openCV. I will open source some related project on my github page.

I created this blog in order to share the things I have learned from my work. I hope some of it can resonate with you. If you would like to enlist my services, please feel free to reach out via email.
