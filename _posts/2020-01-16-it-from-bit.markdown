"It from Bit" is a term coined by the famous American theoretical physicist John Wheeler. In 1990, Wheeler suggested that information is fundamental to the physics of the universe. According to this "it from bit" doctrine, all things physical are information-theoretic in origin:

>It from bit. Otherwise put, every it — every particle, every field of force, even the space-time continuum itself — derives its function, its meaning, its very existence entirely — even if in some contexts indirectly — from the apparatus-elicited answers to yes-or-no questions, binary choices, bits. It from bit symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world has at bottom — a very deep bottom, in most instances — an immaterial source and explanation; that which we call reality arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions and the registering of equipment-evoked responses; in short, that all things physical are information-theoretic in origin and that this is a participatory universe.

Whether this is how our universe works, I am not sure. But I couldn't think of a more fitting term to describe the software development process, where we materialize ideas into reality and try to make a dent in the physical word with it; hence the title of this blog was decided. I think it is perfect for a place where I will be sharing my thoughts on building software - making "it" from "bit".
